## Quick Start

Install the SDK:

go get github.com/scagogogo/go-npm-sdk
```

Basic usage:

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "log"
    
    "github.com/scagogogo/go-npm-sdk/pkg/npm"
)

func main() {
    // Create npm client
    client, err := npm.NewClient()
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    
    ctx := context.Background()
    
    // Check if npm is available
    if !client.IsAvailable(ctx) {
        // Auto-install npm
        if err := client.Install(ctx); err != nil {
            log.Fatal(err)
        }
    }
    
    // Get npm version
    version, err := client.Version(ctx)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    fmt.Printf("npm version: %s\n", version)
}
```
